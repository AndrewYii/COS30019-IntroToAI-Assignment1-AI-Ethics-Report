## ðŸ”– Versioning Guidelines  
The repository uses a **(x.y)** versioning system:  

- **x (Milestone version):**  
  - Incremented when a major milestone is finished and approved by the lecturer.  
  - Example: Completing the introduction and having it approved â†’ **1.0**  

- **y (Update version):**  
  - Incremented for smaller updates (e.g., adding a reference book, completing a paragraph, formatting improvements).  
  - Example: After adding citations to the introduction â†’ **1.1**  

- **Format Example:**  
  - **1.0** â†’ Introduction finished and approved . Milestone Finished.
